#Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

///The client that I created the system designs for is called DriverPass. DriverPass noticed that there are very few tools that train students to pass their driving tests. DriverPass asked us to create an online training system that provided the customer with online classes and resources in order to increase the pass rate of students taking driver classes. •	Our client would like their system to give access to various users, being Liam the Big Boss, Ian, who will be responsible for maintaining the system, the secretary, as well as the end user(DriverPass customers). These users will need to be able to access the customer account and make changes, if necessary.


#What did you do particularly well?

///I believe I created the digrams for the system particularly well. In addition, to designing the diagrams, I would like to shed light on 

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

///One part of my work on the documents that I would like to revise is correct notation for the UML sequence diagram and also complete the technical requirements for the system design documents with more details, to improve understanding for the process of the system.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

///The user needed to be able to log in and create an account in order to access the DriverPass Training Homepage. The user is the main reasoning behind the design of the system. It is important to implement the correct use cases into your system, in order to achieve the goal for the end user of the system. Considering user's needs and making sure that the usability of the system is easy to use, will save time on designing the system for the develope.


#How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
///For designing software, recognizing technical, functional, and non-functional requirements, in order to fully understand what he client needs the system to do.
